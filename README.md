# OblivionMesh.py  
_A self-healing, autonomous RF mesh network for decentralized communication._  

### What It Does:  
- **Forms a peer-to-peer RF communication system with no central authority**  
- **Automatically reroutes messages when nodes go offline**  
- **Uses frequency hopping and adaptive relays to prevent detection**  
- **Ensures no single point of failure can collapse the network**  

### Who Is It For?  
_"A network that cannot be erased  
Is a network that will outlast everything."_  

### How to Use:  
1. Deploy **OblivionMesh** on multiple T-Embed CC1101 modules  
2. Start the self-repairing network:  
   ```bash
   python3 OblivionMesh.py --start
